# VAST 2024 MC3 Data Description - Data dictionary and nodes for MC3

## Graph Description
- Directed multi-graph, allowing multiple edges between nodes
- 60520 nodes
- 75817 edges
- 4782 connected components
- Possible node types are:
  1. Person 
  2. CEO
  3. Organization
  4. Company
  5. FishingCompany
  6. LogisticsCompany
  7. NewsCompany
  8. FinancialCompany
  9. NGO

The graph format is a JSON format generated by Python’s [network.node_link_data()](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/generated/networkx.readwrite.json_graph.node_link_data.html) function. It can likewise be loaded to a networkx object using the corresponding [node_link_graph()](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/generated/networkx.readwrite.json_graph.node_link_graph.html#networkx.readwrite.json_graph.node_link_graph) function. The root-level JSON object consists of graph-level properties specifying that it is directed and a multigraph, a “nodes” key which holds the list of nodes, and a “links” key which holds the list of edges.
